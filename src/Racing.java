 * Course 605.201.81 Summer 2020
 * Mini Project 1
 * 
 * Application Requirements:
 * This project involves writing a program to simulate a tortoise and hare race. 
 * The contenders will each race along a horizontal course that contains at least
 * 50 positions. You may add more if you wish. The race begins with each contender 
 * at position 1. The contender that first reaches or passes the last position of
 * the course is the winner of the race.
 * 
 * There are a number of ways to design this program. One way would be to have a looping
 * construct be the overall controller of things. Each iteration would adjust the contender 
 * positions, and the loop would terminate when one of the contenders reaches the last 
 * square of the race course. You will decide on an approach as part of your design step.
 * 
 * Specifics:
 * 1. Each contender starts at position 1 (from 50). When a contender slips, they 
 *    can’t slip any further left than position 1. 
 * 2. You will use a random number generator to simulate the percentages of each type
 *    of move indicated in the table. To generate random numbers, you can research the
 *    built-in Java random number method that is part of the Math class.
 * 3. Generate a random integer, n, in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10. 
 *           * For the tortoise, perform a fast plod if the number is 1-5, a slow plod 
 *             if the number is 6-8, and a slip if the number is 9-10. 
 *           * For the hare, perform a big hop if the number is 1-2, a small hop if the 
 *             number is 3-5, a big slip if the number is 6, a small slip if the number 
 *             is 7-8, and fall asleep if the number is 9-10.
 * 4. You must keep track of each contender’s position and display it each time positions
 *    change. Show the letter “T” in the position of the tortoise, and the letter “H” in
 *    the position of the Hare. It is possible for the contenders to land on the same 
 *    square. When this happens, the tortoise bites the hare, and your program should 
 *    display “OUCH!!” beginning at that square. All output positions other than the “T”, 
 *    the “H”, and the “OUCH!!” should be blank.
 * 5. If the tortoise wins, display “TORTOISE WINS!!”. If the hare wins, display “HARE WINS!!”.
 *    If the race is a tie, display “IT’S A TIE!!”. At the beginning of the race, display 
 *    “AND THEY’RE OFF!!”.
